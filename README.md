# Word Cloud Generator with Python
This repository contains a simple Python script that allows you to visualize the frequency of words in a given text, transforming them into an attractive word cloud.

This exercise is a great way to understand how visual insights can be extracted from textual data using popular Python libraries.

### About this Project:
The main objective of this exercise is:

- Process text: Take a block of text (or load a text file) as input.
- Count word frequencies: Determine which words appear most and least frequently.
- Visualize the information: Generate an image where the size of each word is proportional to its frequency of occurrence.
- Filter "stop words": Optionally, remove common and insignificant words (such as "the," "the," "and," etc.) to obtain a more relevant visualization.
